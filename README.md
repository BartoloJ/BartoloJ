## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm **Jonathan E. Bartolo**, a U.S. Army veteran with over six years of experience piloting UH-60M Black Hawk helicopters, now transitioning into tech through the Washington Vets to Tech (WaV2T) program. I'm currently developing my skills in software development and cloud technologies, with hands-on experience in AWS, Python, C#, SQL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Django. My journey includes studying data structures, algorithms, and AI-assisted tools, while also working on full-stack web applications and task automation scripts. In addition to a Cloud Application Development certificate, Iâ€™m pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science, expected to graduate in June 2026. I'm passionate about leveraging my troubleshooting and team leadership skills from the Army into tech projects and open-source collaboration.
